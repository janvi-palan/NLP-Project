# Echo Chamber
This project aims to identify echo chambers on Twitter (and eventually, on social media). The project is characterised in two parts: 
1. Multi-class classification model which classifies users into one of 5 categories based on their polarities identified from a sample of their tweets 
2. Identifying the social network relations between users (followers, friends) and creating a graphical data store, and analysing whether users are in echo chambers based on their position in the graph.

All code pertaining to the pre-processing as well as the feature extraction and learning models (ML models, CNN, vectorizers, word2vec embeddings) is present here.
